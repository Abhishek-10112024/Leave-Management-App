<!-- Routing enables single-page applications (SPAs) to navigate between different views without a full page reload. Each route corresponds to a different part of the application -->
<!-- The svelte-routing library uses a declarative approach to define routes, making it easy to visualize which components correspond to which URLs -->
<!-- Each component (like Login, Logout, Register, etc.) is a separate Svelte component that will be rendered when its respective route is matched -->
<!-- The <Router> component manages which of the <Route> components is currently active based on the browser's URL. It handles the rendering of the appropriate component automatically. -->
<!-- If you have a navigation bar or links, ensure you use <Link> components from svelte-routing to enable client-side navigation -->
 <!-- Hereâ€™s how you could add a catch-all route for unmatched URLs: <Route path="*" component={NotFound} /> -->
