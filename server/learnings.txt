// Differences between var, let, and const:
var	                                                                                 let	                                                                                         const
The scope of a var variable is functional or global scope.	                         The scope of a let variable is block scope.	                                                 The scope of a const variable is block scope.
It can be updated and re-declared in the same scope.	                             It can be updated but cannot be re-declared in the same scope.	                                 It can neither be updated or re-declared in any scope.
It can be declared without initialization.	                                         It can be declared without initialization.                                	                     It cannot be declared without initialization.
It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”.	     It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.	         It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.
These variables are hoisted.	                                                     These variables are hoisted but stay in the temporal dead zone untill the initialization.	     These variables are hoisted but stays in the temporal dead zone until the initialization.
